
Dear µC/FS tester,


This project should serve as an "easy start" with µC/FS.
All paths are relative to the project file. You should 
therefore be able to copy the entire directory (including 
all subdirectories) to any location on your harddrive.

This µC/FS trial version is shipped as a library to be 
used with MS Visual C on a PC. It does not contain all 
sources of  µC/FS and therefore you cannot compile the 
library itself to be used on a different architecture.

The maximum number of open files is limited to 4 when
using the trial version. You can use the RAM disk driver
and the Windows driver to access logical drives of
a Windows NT and Windows 2000 system.

Please refer to Chapter 4 of the user manual. You can 
find the user manual unde the \FS\DOC  directory.

You may only use it in order to evaluate µC/FS for 
fitness for a particular purpose. Under no circumstances 
it may be used in a product. If you would like to use
it in a product, please get in touch with us:

Thank you for your interest in our products.
