#
# Typical usage:
# For non root user:
#      httpd -p 8080 -h $HOME/public_html
# For daemon start from rc script with uid=0:
#      httpd -u www
# which is equivalent to (assuming user www has uid 80):
#      httpd -p 80 -u 80 -h $PWD -c /etc/httpd.conf -r "Web Server Authentication"
#
# When an url starts with "/cgi-bin/" it is assumed to be a cgi script.
# The server changes directory to the location of the script and executes it
# after setting QUERY_STRING and other environment variables.
#
# If directory URL is given, no index.html is found and CGI support is enabled,
# cgi-bin/index.cgi will be run. Directory to list is ../$QUERY_STRING.
# See httpd_indexcgi.c for an example GCI code.
#
# Doc:
# "CGI Environment Variables": http:#hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html
#
# The applet can also be invoked as an url arg decoder and html text encoder
# as follows:
#      foo=`httpd -d $foo`             # decode "Hello%20World" as "Hello World"
#      bar=`httpd -e "<Hello World>"`  # encode as "&#60Hello&#32World&#62"
# Note that url encoding for arguments is not the same as html encoding for
# presentation.  -d decodes an url-encoded argument while -e encodes in html
# for page display.
#
# httpd.conf has the following format:
#
 
  H:/home/www     # define the server root. It will override -h
  A:172.20.         # Allow address from 172.20.0.0/16
  A:10.0.0.0/25     # Allow any address from 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.127
  A:10.0.0.0/255.255.255.128  # Allow any address that previous set
  A:127.0.0.1       # Allow local loopback connections
#  D:*               # Deny from other IP connections
#  E404:/path/e404.html # /path/e404.html is the 404 (not found) error page
  I:index.html      # Show index.html when a directory is requested
 
#  P:/url:[http:#]hostname[:port]/new/path
                    # When /urlXXXXXX is requested, reverse proxy
                    # it to http:#hostname[:port]/new/pathXXXXXX
 
   /home/www/cgi-bin:foo:bar  # Require user foo, pwd bar on urls starting with /cgi-bin/
#  /adm:admin:setup  # Require user admin, pwd setup on urls starting with /adm/
#  /adm:toor:PaSsWd  # or user toor, pwd PaSsWd on urls starting with /adm/
#  /adm:root:*       # or user root, pwd from /etc/passwd on urls starting with /adm/
#  /wiki:*:*         # or any user from /etc/passwd with according pwd on urls starting with /wiki/
#  .au:audio/basic   # additional mime type for audio.au files
# .php:/path/php   # run xxx.php through an interpreter
 

# A/D may be as a/d or allow/deny - only first char matters.
# Deny/Allow IP logic:
#  - Default is to allow all (Allow all (A:*) is a no-op).
#  - Deny rules take precedence over allow rules.
#  - "Deny all" rule (D:*) is applied last.
#
# Example:
#   1. Allow only specified addresses
#     A:172.20          # Allow any address that begins with 172.20.
#     A:10.10.          # Allow any address that begins with 10.10.
#     A:127.0.0.1       # Allow local loopback connections
#     D:*               # Deny from other IP connections
#
#   2. Only deny specified addresses
#     D:1.2.3.        # deny from 1.2.3.0 - 1.2.3.255
#     D:2.3.4.        # deny from 2.3.4.0 - 2.3.4.255
#     A:*             # (optional line added for clarity)
#
# If a sub directory contains config file, it is parsed and merged with
# any existing settings as if it was appended to the original configuration.
#
# subdir paths are relative to the containing subdir and thus cannot
# affect the parent rules.
#
# Note that since the sub dir is parsed in the forked thread servicing the
# subdir http request, any merge is discarded when the process exits.  As a
# result, the subdir settings only have a lifetime of a single request.
#
# Custom error pages can contain an absolute path or be relative to
# 'home_httpd'. Error pages are to be static files (no CGI or script). Error
# page can only be defined in the root configuration file and are not taken
# into account in local (directories) config files.
#
# If -c is not set, an attempt will be made to open the default
# root configuration file.  If -c is set and the file is not found, the
# server exits with an error.
